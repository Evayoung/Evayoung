# 👋 Hi, I'm Olorundare Micheal

I'm a passionate **software developer** and **AI agent enthusiast** focused on building robust, scalable applications and REST APIs that solve real-world problems. My strength lies in **Python-based development**, creating efficient backend systems, and occasionally crafting intuitive UI designs. 

I enjoy tackling challenges in domains like **cooperative management, health tech, e-commerce**, and **data security**, with a deep interest in **AI-driven automation** and prototyping. I also bring experience building **CMS** and **e-commerce** platforms with WordPress, Joomla, and WooCommerce.
